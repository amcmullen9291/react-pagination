# pagination

This repo paginates fetched data in both class components and functional components using react-paginate as well as setting limits on fetch requests. 


For bigger and constantly growing projects, client side, there may not much you can do unless pagination is implemented on the API side. But, if it is, API requests can be made using parameters like offset, or page, to control how much data is retured from the API. 


Data fetched from
